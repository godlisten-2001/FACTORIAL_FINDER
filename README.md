# FACTORIAL_FINDER
## Description
This project implements functions to calculate the factorial of a positive integer using both loops and recursion. The factorial of a positive integer n is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1, and the factorial of zero 0 is defined as being 1.

## Features
* Calculates factorial using both loops and recursion.
* Supports positive integers as input.
* Handles edge case for factorial of 0.

## Usage
To use the factorial solver functions:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/godlisten-2001/FACTORIAL_FINDER.git
